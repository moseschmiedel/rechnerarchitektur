# Performance analysis of Sobel-Algorithm-Implementation

The code in this repository was created for analyzing the performance of the
implementation of the [Sobel-Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
found in `sobel.c`.
This analysis was an assignment in the Rechnerarchitektur(computer architecture) module
at HTWK Leipzig.

All data collected and the binaries used for the analysis can be found in the `abgabe/`
directory.
